# Classification-of-Patients
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources used to conduct a preliminary prognosis of hypertension/hypotension based on the level of hemoglobin and genetic history of individuals. The project aims to employ statistical techniques, including traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to build models that predict the likelihood of blood pressure abnormalities.

Contents:
1. Code: 
   - `blood_pressure_abnormality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. Report:
   - `blood_pressure_prediction_report.pdf`: A detailed report showcasing the results of the predictive modeling approach, including model performance metrics, insights from EDA, and recommendations.
3. Case Study:
   - `blood_pressure_prediction_case_study.pdf`: A document outlining the requirements and objectives of the case study, providing context and guidelines for solving the problem.

Feel free to explore the repository, run the code, and review the report and case study document for a comprehensive understanding of the project. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
